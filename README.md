# Udacity P2 - Online Resume

**Project Overview**

Wrote the JavaScript that powers my own online resume. 

This project was completed while taking the Udacity JavaScript Basics course by writing a JS script that combined my personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate my resume.
Used basic JavaScript syntax, which includes manipulating JSON data, building loops and creating functions. Used jQuery DOM manipulation methods to build my Resume the moment a user opens my website.
